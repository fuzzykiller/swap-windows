# swap-windows

On resume from hibernation, Windows often switches windows between monitor 1
and 2 on my system. This applications takes windows on these monitors and moves
each to the other monitor.

Technically the application does not deal with monitors at all but only the
absolute logical window positions.

Inspired heavily by examples in the “windows” crate.
